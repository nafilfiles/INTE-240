    <h1>Amazing Grace by John Newton</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>&#9835Amazing grace <strong>(how sweet the sound)</strong><br>
    that saved a wretch like <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Newton" target="_blank">me!</a><br>
    I once was <em>lost</em>, but now am <em>found,</em><br>
    was <em>blind</em>, but now I see.&#9835<br></p>

    <p>&#9835<strong>'Twas <a href="https://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/grace">grace</a> that taught my heart to fear,<br>
    and grace my fears relieved;<br>
    how precious did that grace appear<br>
    the hour I first believed!</strong>&#9835<br></p>

    <p>&#9835Through <em>many</em> dangers, toils and snares<br>
    I have already come:<br>
    'tis <em>grace</em> has brought me safe thus far,<br>
    and <em>grace</em> will lead me home.&#9835<br></p>

    <p>&#9835The Lord has promised good to me,<br>
    his word my hope secures;<br>
    he will my shield and portion be<br>
    as long as life <em>endures.</em>&#9835<br></p>
    
    <p>&#9835Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,<br>
    and mortal life shall cease:<br>
    I shall possess, within the veil,<br>
    a life of joy and peace.&#9835<br></p>

    <p>&#9835The earth shall <em>soon</em> dissolve like snow,<br>
    the sun forbear to shine;<br>
    but <em>God</em>, who called me here below,<br>
    will be <strong>forever</strong> mine.&#9835</p>
